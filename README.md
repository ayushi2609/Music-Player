# What I Learned
During the development of this Music Player project using HTML and CSS, I gained valuable insights and learned several key concepts. Here are some of the takeaways:

## HTML5 Audio Element
I deepened my understanding of the HTML5 `<audio>` element and its attributes. This element is fundamental for embedding audio content in web pages, and I learned how to use it to create a simple yet effective music player interface.

Version Control with Git
I practiced version control using Git throughout the development process. Commits, branches, and pull requests were utilized for effective collaboration and project management.
These learnings collectively enhanced my skills in web development and provided valuable hands-on experience with building a practical HTML and CSS-based project.
